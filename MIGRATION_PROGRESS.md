# Migration Progress Tracker

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-05
**Current Phase:** Phase 2 Complete
**Status:** ✅ Event system migrated, ready for Phase 3

---

## Phase Completion Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Cleanup (COMPLETE)
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Commit:** `6a8e1ee`

**Completed:**
- ✅ Deleted `packages/timeline/` (13MB duplicate code)
- ✅ Backed up `packages/core/` → `packages/core-agent-brain-backup/`
- ✅ Created new `packages/core/` with domain structure:
  - `src/domains/` (events, intelligence, providers, visualization, extension)
  - `src/infrastructure/` (registries, logging, testing, storage, config)
  - `tests/` (pathways, fixtures, mocks, setup, utils)
- ✅ Set up build configuration (package.json, tsconfig.json)
- ✅ Updated root package.json scripts
- ✅ Git checkpoint created

**Verification:**
- ✅ Directory structure created correctly
- ✅ Configuration files in place
- ✅ Git commit successful
- ⏸️ Tests not yet run (no code moved yet)

### ✅ Phase 2: Domain: Events (COMPLETE)
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Commit:** `5fd3544`

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created modular event system in `core/domains/events/`:
  - EventType.ts (enum with all event types including future ones)
  - Author.ts, ImpactMetrics.ts, VisualizationHints.ts, EventSource.ts
  - CanonicalEvent.ts (main interface with imports)
  - types.ts (FilterState, FilterOptions, ProviderContext, etc.)
  - index.ts (unified exports)
- ✅ Configured TypeScript path mapping (`@agent-brain/core/*`)
- ✅ Updated 13 files with new import paths
- ✅ Built core package successfully
- ✅ Git checkpoint created

**Verification:**
- ✅ Core package compiles without errors
- ✅ All event types properly exported
- ✅ VSCode package imports updated
- ⏸️ Tests not yet run (will test after more components moved)

---

## Next Steps

### 📋 Phase 3: Domain: Providers (2-3 hours)
**Goal:** Move CanonicalEvent system to `core/domains/events/`

**Tasks:**
1. Move CanonicalEvent files from vscode to core
2. Extract EventType enum, Author, ImpactMetrics, VisualizationHints into separate files
3. Update all imports in vscode package
4. Configure TypeScript path mapping
5. Build and test (149 pathway tests must still pass)
6. Git checkpoint

**Files to move:**
- `packages/vscode/src/core/CanonicalEvent.ts` → `packages/core/src/domains/events/`

**Files to create:**
- `packages/core/src/domains/events/EventType.ts`
- `packages/core/src/domains/events/Author.ts`
- `packages/core/src/domains/events/ImpactMetrics.ts`
- `packages/core/src/domains/events/VisualizationHints.ts`
- `packages/core/src/domains/events/types.ts`
- `packages/core/src/domains/events/index.ts`

## Migration Checkpoints

### ✅ Checkpoint 1: Foundation Established
**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Commit:** `6a8e1ee`
**Status:** Complete

- New core package structure created
- Old packages backed up and deleted
- Build configuration in place
- Ready to move code

### 🔄 Checkpoint 2: Extension Working (Target)
**After Phase 8**
- Extension builds and packages
- 149+ pathway tests passing
- Timeline shows: Git + GitHub + Intelligence
- All existing functionality preserved

### ⏸️ Checkpoint 3: Agent Emissions Added (Future)
**After Phase 11**
- Timeline shows agent tasks
- Prompt-based event model working
- All pathway tests passing

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Backup Strategy:** Moved `packages/core/` to `packages/core-agent-brain-backup/` for safety
2. **Structure:** Created domain-driven architecture as per ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN_V3.md
3. **Testing:** Will verify 149 pathway tests after each code move
4. **Git Strategy:** Checkpoint after each successful phase

---

## Notes

- Agent-brain intelligence code is safely backed up in `packages/core-agent-brain-backup/`
- Will migrate to `packages/core/src/domains/intelligence/` in Phase 6
- Current vscode extension remains untouched and functional
- No functionality changes until Phase 2 begins
