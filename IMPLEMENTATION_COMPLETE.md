## User Experience

### Simplified Workflow

**Before Agent Brain:**
```
1. Think of what to build
2. Paste basic prompt into AI
3. Get generic response
4. No tracking of work
5. Knowledge lost between sessions
```

**With Agent Brain:**
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+A
2. See enhanced prompt with relevant knowledge
3. Choose to track session or just copy
4. Work gets automatically tracked
5. Session appears in timeline
6. Knowledge builds over time
```

### Visual Polish

- Clear command names
- Intuitive keybindings
- Progress indicators
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Visual distinction in timeline (green stars vs cyan circles)

---

## Technical Achievements

### Domain-Driven Design

Successfully separated concerns:
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic (sessions, knowledge, events)
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Storage, logging, registries
- **VSCode Layer**: Commands, adapters, providers

### Event-Driven Architecture

- SessionManager emits events
- Multiple systems listen and react
- Loose coupling between components
- Easy to extend

### Provider Pattern

- Pluggable data sources
- Uniform interface (IDataProvider)
- Easy to add new providers
- Git, GitHub, and Sessions all use same model

---

1. **README.md** - Quick start and overview
2. **FAQ Section** - Common questions answered
3. **Usage Examples** - Real-world workflows

### Developer-Facing

1. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Comprehensive technical doc
2. **PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md** - VSCode integration details

4. **PHASE_4_DAY_1_COMPLETE.md** - Provider implementation
5. **BUILD_GUIDE.md** - Build and packaging instructions
6. **KNOWN_ISSUES.md** - Test issues documentation

### Code Documentation

- Inline comments on complex logic
- JSDoc for public APIs
- Type definitions with descriptions
- Architecture diagrams in docs

---

## What We Learned

### Design Decisions That Worked

1. **Markdown Enhancement > XML**: Simpler, more compatible with AI agents
2. **File-based Storage**: Easy to debug, version, and share
3. **Provider Pattern**: Made timeline integration seamless
4. **BaseCommand Pattern**: Consistent error handling
5. **Domain Separation**: Made testing and maintenance easier

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Type Mismatches**: Fixed by checking actual type definitions
2. **Provider Integration**: Solved by following existing patterns
3. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Simple keyword matching works well
4. **Session Lifecycle**: Event-driven approach handles edge cases
