 The Vibe Coder Context

  Who they are:
  - Not traditional software engineers, but creative builders who "vibe code"
  - Use AI agents (Copilot, Cursor, Claude) as primary coding partners
  - Focus on intent over implementation - they describe what they want, AI writes code
  - Care about momentum over perfection
  - Often lose track of what changed when agents make lots of edits
  - Don't naturally think in git commits, branches, or pull requests
  - Need storytelling, not just git history

  Current pain points:
  - "Wait, what did the AI just change across 15 files?"
  - "Which version had the working login? It broke somewhere..."
  - "I asked for X, the agent did Y, Z, and broke W"
  - "I can't explain to my teammate what happened in this session"
  - "The AI made 50 commits in 10 minutes, which one matters?"

  💡 Feature Ideas for Agent-Assisted Vibe Coding

  1. Session-Based Timeline (vs. Commit-Based)

  What: Group timeline events by "coding sessions" rather than just commits

  Why: Vibe coders work in intense bursts with agents. A session might be:
  - 2-hour conversation with Cursor
  - 30 minutes of Copilot autocompletes
  - An afternoon with Claude Code fixing tests

  Visual concept:
  Timeline shows:
  ━━━ Session: "Adding user authentication" (2:15pm - 4:30pm) ━━━
      ├─ 23 commits (collapsed by default)
      ├─ 15 files changed
      ├─ AI agent: Cursor
      ├─ Intent: "Add login with Google OAuth"
      └─ Outcome: ✅ Tests passing / ⚠️ Partially working / ❌ Broken

  ━━━ Session: "Fixed the auth redirect bug" (5:00pm - 5:20pm) ━━━
      ├─ 3 commits
      ├─ 2 files changed
      ├─ AI agent: Claude
      └─ Quick fix session

  How:
  - Detect sessions by time gaps (>30min = new session)
  - Extract "intent" from first commit message or chat history
  - Show collapsed view by default, expand to see individual commits
  - Color-code by outcome (green=tests pass, yellow=partial, red=broken)

  ---
  2. "What Changed?" Diff Summaries in Plain English

  What: AI-generated natural language summaries of what actually changed

  Why: Vibe coders don't read diffs. They need: "This session added a login form component, updated the API client, and refactored error handling."

  Visual concept:
  Hover on session bubble shows:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Session: Adding user authentication │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ 📝 Summary (AI-generated):          │
  │ • Created LoginForm.tsx component   │
  │ • Added OAuth redirect handling     │
  │ • Updated API client with auth      │
  │ • Modified 3 existing tests         │
  │ • Added GoogleAuthProvider wrapper  │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ ⚠️ Warning:                         │
  │ • Removed error logging from API    │
  │   (might need to add back)          │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘

  How:
  - Use GPT-4/Claude API to summarize diffs on-hover
  - Cache summaries to avoid repeated API calls
  - Highlight unexpected changes (deletions, refactors)
  - Optional: Use local LLM for privacy-conscious users

  ---
  3. "Rewind to When It Worked" Feature

  What: One-click jump to the last working state

  Why: Vibe coders often break things after multiple agent iterations. GitLens requires knowing git commands.

  Visual concept:
  Timeline markers:
  ○ ← Last commit where tests passed (2:45pm)
  ● ← Current state (tests failing)

  Button: "⏪ Rewind to last working state"
          ↓
      Shows: "Reset to commit abc123 (2:45pm)?"
             "You'll lose 15 commits. Continue?"
             [Yes, create backup branch] [Cancel]

  How:
  - Automatically mark commits with test status
  - Track "known good" states (tests passing, builds successful)
  - Offer safe rewind: creates backup branch before reset
  - Smart enough to preserve uncommitted work

  ---
  4. AI Agent Annotations on Timeline

  What: Show which AI agent made which changes

  Why: Different agents have different strengths. Knowing "Cursor wrote this, Claude fixed that" helps debug.

  Visual concept:
  Timeline with agent icons:
  ○─── [Cursor icon] Initial feature
      ○─── [Copilot icon] Added types
          ○─── [Claude icon] Fixed bug
              ○─── [Human icon] Manual tweak

  How:
  - Detect agent from git commit metadata (Cursor adds signatures)
  - Or: VS Code extension tracks active coding assistant
  - Allow manual tagging: "This was Claude" / "This was me"
  - Filter timeline by agent: "Show only human commits"

  ---
  5. "Intent → Outcome" Tracking

  What: Link what you asked for to what actually happened

  Why: Vibe coders give high-level instructions. Did the agent do what was asked?

  Visual concept:
  Timeline bubble:
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 🎯 Intent (from chat):                   │
  │ "Add a dark mode toggle to the navbar"  │
  ├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ 🤖 Agent Actions:                        │
  │ ✅ Created DarkModeToggle.tsx            │
  │ ✅ Updated Navbar to use toggle          │
  │ ✅ Added theme context                   │
  │ ⚠️ Also modified global styles (why?)   │
  │ ❌ Didn't update mobile navbar           │
  ├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ 📊 Outcome:                              │
  │ ✅ Desktop dark mode works               │
  │ ⚠️ Mobile still light theme only         │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────┘

  How:
  - Parse chat history from Cursor/Copilot/Claude
  - Match intent to commit messages
  - AI compares intent vs actual file changes
  - Flag discrepancies (agent did extra stuff)

  ---
  6. "Undo Last Agent Session" Button

  What: Atomic undo for entire AI-driven sessions

  Why: Sometimes agents go down rabbit holes. Easier than git commands.

  Visual concept:
  Right-click on session:
  ├─ Undo this entire session
  ├─ Undo but keep [specific file]
  ├─ Review what will be undone
  └─ Create comparison branch

  How:
  - Group commits by session (time-based or manual)
  - Generate "undo plan" showing exactly what reverts
  - Safety: always create backup branch
  - Preserve uncommitted work in stash

  ---
  7. "Tell Me What Happened" AI Narrator

  What: Natural language explanation of timeline segment

  Why: Explaining progress to non-technical stakeholders or team members

  Visual concept:
  Select timeline range (Monday 9am → Friday 5pm)
  Click "Summarize this week"

  Output:
  "This week the team focused on user authentication.

  On Monday, Cursor helped build the initial login form
  and Google OAuth integration. Tuesday involved fixing
  redirect bugs with Claude's help.

  Wednesday-Thursday saw extensive testing and edge case
  handling. By Friday, the auth system was working with
  120 tests passing.

  However, there's still an open issue with mobile logout
  that needs attention next week."

  How:
  - AI summarizes commit messages, file changes, test results
  - Use chat history for extra context
  - Generate in different styles: technical, executive summary, changelog
  - Export as markdown for stand-ups or documentation

  ---
  8. "Branch Confusion Solver"

  What: Visual branch state with "where am I?" clarity

  Why: Vibe coders get lost in branch hell when agents create branches

  Visual concept:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 📍 You are here:                    │
  │ Branch: feature/auth                │
  │ Behind main by: 3 commits           │
  │ Ahead of main by: 15 commits        │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ 🔀 Quick Actions:                   │
  │ • Pull latest from main             │
  │ • Merge main into this branch       │
  │ • Create PR to main                 │
  │ • Compare with main                 │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘

  How:
  - Always show current branch prominently
  - Calculate branch distance visually
  - One-click git operations (pull, merge, PR)
  - Warn before destructive actions

  ---
  9. "Code Smell" Detector on Timeline

  What: Visual indicators when code quality degraded

  Why: Agents sometimes create working but messy code. Catch technical debt early.

  Visual concept:
  Timeline with smell indicators:
  ○─── Normal commit
      ⚠️─── Complexity increased +30%
          ○─── Tests added (good!)
              🔴─── Duplicate code detected
                  ○─── Refactored (smell fixed)

  How:
  - Run static analysis on each commit (background)
  - Track metrics: complexity, duplication, test coverage
  - Show trends: "Code quality trending down this session"
  - Suggest: "Consider refactoring before continuing"

  ---
  10. "Export for AI Context" Feature

  What: Package timeline segment for feeding to AI agents

  Why: When asking agents for help, need concise history context

  Visual concept:
  Select timeline range, click "Export for AI"

  Generates:
  "# Project Context (Last 3 days)

  ## What We Built
  - User authentication with Google OAuth
  - Dark mode toggle
  - Mobile responsive navbar

  ## Current State
  - ✅ 120/123 tests passing
  - ⚠️ 3 failing tests in auth/logout.test.ts
  - 🔴 ESLint warnings in 5 files

  2. src/api/auth.ts (12 edits)
  3. src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx (8 edits)

  ## Known Issues
  - Mobile logout not redirecting correctly
  - Dark mode flickers on initial load

  ---
  [Paste this to Claude/Cursor for context]"

  How:
  - Intelligently summarize recent timeline
  - Include test status, file change frequency
  - Add known issues from comments/TODOs
  - Format for easy copy-paste to chat

  ---
  11. "Teaching Timeline" for Onboarding

  What: Annotated timeline explaining why decisions were made

  Why: Vibe coders often work solo, then need to onboard teammates

  Visual concept:
  Timeline with teaching notes:
  ○─── "Started with simple auth"
       💡 Note: "We chose OAuth over email because..."
      ○─── "Added session management"
          💡 Note: "Redux was too heavy, using Context API"
          ○─── "Switched to JWT tokens"
              💡 Note: "After security review, moved from localStorage to httpOnly cookies"

  How:
  - Allow adding notes to any commit/session
  - AI suggests notes: "This refactor appears to fix memory leak"
  - Export annotated timeline as documentation
  - Team members can add their own teaching notes

  ---
  12. "Parallel Universe" Comparison

  What: Compare alternate approaches side-by-side

  Why: Agents often generate multiple solutions. Which was better?

  Visual concept:
  Split timeline view:
  Branch A: feature/auth-oauth     Branch B: feature/auth-email
  ├─ 12 commits                    ├─ 8 commits
  ├─ 15 files changed              ├─ 10 files changed
  ├─ Tests: 98% pass               ├─ Tests: 100% pass
  ├─ Bundle: +45KB                 ├─ Bundle: +12KB
  └─ Complexity: Medium            └─ Complexity: Low

  [Compare implementations]
  [Merge best parts from both]

  How:
  - Visual branch comparison with metrics
  - Highlight trade-offs (speed vs bundle size)
  - Allow cherry-picking commits from either branch
  - AI recommends which approach aligns with project goals

  ---
  13. "Blame the Agent" (Humorous but Useful)

  What: Like git blame, but shows which agent wrote each line

  Why: Debugging is easier when you know "this was Copilot autocomplete" vs "Claude carefully wrote this"

  Visual concept:
  Code view with agent annotations:
   1 │ function login(email, password) {     [You, manual]
   2 │   const hashedPassword = sha256(...   [Copilot]
   3 │   // TODO: Add rate limiting           [Claude]
   4 │   return api.post('/auth', {...       [Cursor]
   5 │ }                                      [You, manual]

  How:
  - Track which tool was active during each edit
  - Store in git metadata or separate index
  - Show in hover tooltip or gutter icon
  - Filter: "Hide lines written by Copilot"

  ---
  14. "Momentum Meter"

  What: Visual indicator of coding velocity

  Why: Vibe coders care about flow state and productive sessions

  Visual concept:
  Top of timeline:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 🚀 Momentum: ████████░░ 80%            │
  │                                         │
  │ This week: Highly productive           │
  │ • 5 features shipped                    │
  │ • 2 bugs fixed                          │
  │ • Average session: 1.5 hours            │
  │                                         │
  │ 💡 Peak productivity: Tue 2-4pm        │
  │ 😴 Slow time: Fri after 5pm             │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

  How:
  - Calculate commits per hour, session length
  - Track test pass rate as quality proxy
  - Identify productive patterns (time of day)
  - Gamification: streak counters, milestones

  ---
  15. Integration with Chat History

  What: Link timeline events to actual chat conversations

  Why: The "why" lives in chat, the "what" lives in commits

  Visual concept:
  Timeline bubble links to chat:
  ○─── "Added dark mode"
       💬 [View chat thread (12 messages)]
          ↓
      Opens side panel with:
      "User: Can you add dark mode to the navbar?
       Agent: I'll create a ThemeContext and toggle button...
       User: Make sure it persists across sessions
       Agent: Added localStorage persistence..."

  How:
  - Cursor/Claude extensions provide chat history APIs
  - Match chat timestamps to commit timestamps
  - Embed chat references in git commit metadata
  - Search: "Find all commits related to 'dark mode' chat"

  ---

  💭 The Big Insight

  Traditional git tools (GitLens, Tower, etc.) are built for software engineers who think in branches, commits, and pull requests.

  Vibe coders think in:
  - "I asked for X"
  - "It worked before"
  - "The agent changed too much"
  - "What actually happened?"

  Your timeline tool should be a story viewer, not just a commit log. It should answer:
  - "What did I build today?" (not "what commits did I make?")
  - "When did it break?" (not "which commit introduced the bug?")
  - "What did the agent do?" (not "what is the diff?")
  - "How do I undo this?" (not "how do I git reset?")

  The tool becomes a collaboration journal between human and AI, not just a version control visualization.
