# Agent Brain Platform

**Unified platform for AI-assisted development with timeline visualization, architectural guidance, and pathway testing**

## Overview

Agent Brain Platform combines the power of:
- ðŸ“Š **Timeline Visualization**: Rich D3-based visualization of development events
- ðŸ§  **Agent Brain Core**: Pattern detection, learning, and architectural guidance
- ðŸ§ª **Pathway Testing**: Revolutionary milestone-based testing framework
- ðŸ”Œ **Plugin Marketplace**: Extensible architecture pattern plugins

## Architecture

This is a monorepo using Lerna and npm workspaces:

```
packages/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/     - Shared types and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ core/       - Agent Brain core engine (patterns, learning, analysis)
â”œâ”€â”€ timeline/   - Timeline visualization and event management
â”œâ”€â”€ testing/    - Pathway testing framework
â””â”€â”€ vscode/     - Unified VSCode extension
```

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Watch mode for development
npm run watch
```
